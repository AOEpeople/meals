## Devbox Installation
We're using [ddev](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/) for local development. `ddev` is a CLI tool which uses Docker to simplify local development. Please make sure that `ddev`, `mkcert` and `docker` are installed. Before starting the Devbox run:
```
mkcert -install 
```

To simplify things, we have put common commands into a **Makefile**. To see all available options, run the following command:
```
make
```

Run the following to start the Devbox:
```
make run-devbox
```

Point your web browser to https://meals.test  :tada:

:memo:  Don't forget to add `127.0.0.1 meals.test` to your local hosts file if not done automatically via ddev.

## Troubleshooting

### SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column

    ddev exec php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force --env=dev
