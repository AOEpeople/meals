## Devbox Installation
We're using [ddev](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/) for local development. `ddev` is a CLI tool which uses Docker to simplify local development. Please make sure that `ddev`, `mkcert` and `docker` are installed. Before starting the Devbox run:
```
mkcert -install
```

To simplify things, we have put common commands into a **Makefile**. To see all available options, run the following command:
```
make
```

Run the following to start the Devbox:
```
make run-devbox
```

Point your web browser to https://meals.test  :tada:

:memo:  Don't forget to add `127.0.0.1 meals.test` to your local hosts file if not done automatically via ddev.

To run End-to-End testing via cypress run the following command:
```
make run-cypress
```
You need to start the devbox before running any tests with cypress.

## Component testing

To run specific component tests with Vitest in isolation:
```
ddev exec npm run --prefix src/Resources test:unit -- "<test-filename> <testname>"
```
`<test-filename>` for a file with the name `xyz.spec.ts` would be `xyz`
`<testname>` is optional, if no testname is specified the whole file is run

## Linting

There are several lintig and formatting checks for the front- and backend. These are also executed in the GitHub-Actions workflows. Every check can be run manually and locally with the following make commands.

#### ESLint
Frontend asset linting
```
make run-lint
```

#### Prettier
Frontend formatting check
```
make run-prettier-check
```
Frontend automated formatting
```
make run-prettier
```

#### Vue-Tsc
Check TypeScript types
```
make run-typecheck
```

#### Php-CS-Fixer
Backend linting
```
make run-cs-fixer
```

#### Phpmd
Backend linting
```
make run-phpmd
```

#### Psalm
Backend linting
```
make run-psalm
```

## Troubleshooting

### SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column

    ddev exec php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force --env=dev

## Developer information

### Vite

Vite has two different modes of operation. One where a production ready build is generated and a dev mode. The dev mode is best used to quickly iterate and rebuild over changes while working.


### User roles

The following roles are in use:

  * ROLE_USER: basically everyone who is allowed to join the meals
  * ROLE_KITCHEN_STAFF: allowed to create and edit dishes and meals
  * ROLE_GUEST: for users who are invited for a meal, e.g. customers etc.
  * ROLE_ADMIN: for users who are admins
  * ROLE_FINANCE: for users who are from finance

### Login
There are two possibilities for authentication. Either OAuth or a classic login via the database. The modes can be toggled with the `APP_AUTH_MODE` environment variable in `.env`.
For User authentication using oauth with a custom identity provider you must define the following env vars with correct values in `.env.local`:

```shell
IDP_SERVER=https://login.some-domain.com/
IDP_CLIENT_ID=client-id
IDP_CLIENT_SECRET=client-secret
```

### Dev Warning

In the Vite Dev mode browsers will typically send out a Warning("Source-Map-Fehler: No sources are declared in this source map."). This can be mitigated by using the build mode.
