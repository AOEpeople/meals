# Testing With Cypress

### Scope

We use Cypress for end-to-end frontend testing.

### Prepare Local Test Execution

- Check out the repository 'testing-cypress'.
- Run 'yarn install' in test directory.

### Execute Tests Locally

- Start Cypress UI with 'yarn open: ...' and execute specs manually or
- Run whole test suite headless with 'yarn run: ...' ('run' currently excludes snapshot tests)

And add this to the respective command:
